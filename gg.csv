After reading lots of reviews I didn't expect much from it, but it is perfect. It's holding my 32 inch Vizio  tv in my bedroom perfectly. My boyfriend did tighten lots of different bolts on it after it was up so it would be completely level. I think the people that say it sags didn't do this. He did use his own level and not the one it came with. I helped him when he did this. I held the tv in the position that made it level and he tightened lots of stuff until it held it there. I have had it up for a couple months with no problem. I love it. Perfect for the price. The hardest part was finding the stud.

Kennedy \kennedy610\""""";[2, 2];Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-);4.0;Well made, Excellent Value;1363305600;03 15, 2013;;

At the 180 degree extension, there is very noticeable tilt, which gets worse each day, until the TV is tilting sort of comically. If you are just using it to watch a TV &#34;head-on&#34; the tilt probably won't matter to you, but if you are using it at any sort of angle for a large TV you will have the tilt problem. The arm is simply not designed properly to handle the 180 degree extension.Also, if you are new to this TV mount thing, note that this VESA 400 compatible mount will not necessarily work for your VESA 400 compatible TV. I discovered that not all VESA 400 mounts work with all VESA 400 TVs. I had to &#34;improvise&#34; to get this mount to work and could not use any of the mounting configurations in the instruction booklet. This problem had no bearing on the &#34;tilt&#34; problem described above. I don't really understand what the point is of listing VESA compatibility when it doesn't seem to actually indicate compatibility, but there must be some tech guru who has a complex and useless explanation for it somewhere.Otherwise, the installation was fairly easy. In about two hours I was able to get this attached to my wall, where it immediately began it's slow drooping progress toward the floor.

A14J537H58XBYV;972683275;rickas;[1, 2];Now that it is installed it is fine.  But installation was a pain.  Unlike other similar low priced mounts, this does not have a separate plate that you mount to the TV then mount to the bracket.  You have to hold the TV up in position, align with bracket holes and start screws.  Try that on ladders 6 feet in the air,  with a 40 or 50 pound TV.  I bought some screws of proper size, cut off the head and used 2 as locating guides to get screw holes aligned.  Started 2 screws then replace my starter studs with screws. Made it easier but NOT easy.  Also adjustment is very difficult with TV installed.  Weight of TV binds the adjusting bracket when you loosen set screw.  I would NOT recommend this mount there are better choices.

So, for this VideSecu mount, inspite of poor installation instructions, I carfeully measured all domensions to fit my new 32\"" Samsung LED SmartTV in a limited kitchen space. My mistake was, based on the diagrams, I assumed that the length of both the swinging arms of the mount (the single and the double arms) were of the same length. What a disaster! After installing the mount when I mounted the TV and folded the arms the TV did not center itself to the wall side of the mount! It was then that I noticed the inner length of the 2 arms is about 4\"" longer than the outer single arm. In other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my TV was not centered in the limited space that I had and looked awful. I don't know why the manufacturer did not keep both arms the same length. At least they shd have mentioned it in the instructions.This to me is a major product defect.

I bought this mount because the new place I moved into built the studs too far apart for my other mount. This item seemed a little questionable, but I went with it because of the reviews.

I don't know how well it would stand up to being run into or being in an earthquake, but then again if those are potential issues then maybe a wall mount isn't too ideal in the first place!

Pictures do not distinguish between Stud mount and concrete. Also the instructions do not tell you the size of the included boltsFor those of you who have never worked in the home building industry wall studs are usually 1.5 inches wide so this mount only requires 2 lag bolts in the middle holes to secure it to the wall to support a 23 lb TV. The four outboard holes on the wall mount are 1.3\ apart so don't try to use them in a wall stud measuring 1.5\"" wide.Helpful hint: I have help install at least 6 other wall mounts because of family or friends so I cannot say that I am an expert but my suggestion is to drill pilot holes which the instructions do not tell you to do.After comparing the instructions on this unit to others I have installed I still must say that the pictures should have a lot more detail.

I had to struggle a bit to get the TV angle just right since there was quite a bit of binding between the hinge pin and the sleeve.  I couldn't free the TV either and reposition myself due to the binding.  Eventually, I powered through it and got the sleeve seated on the pin.

A19HA89L528MI2;972683275;Scott;[0, 0];This is a very sturdy and high quality wall mount. The metal is indicative of much higher-priced models than the low price of this item. Once you have it mounted, it works great with a full range of motion and the tv feels very secure.The only problem I have is the installation process itself. You have to loosen all the nuts required for getting the range of motion, and it seems that the nuts were all tightened at the strongest-man-in-the-world competition. It was VERY difficult to get them to loosen initially.The other installation issue is that the extensions that are included to mount different size TVs did not align properly and the screws provided were the wrong height. The mount comes with a bunch of different screws with varying lengths and thickness, but none of them worked without modification. As a result of those two problems, I had to come up with a jury-rig solution to getting the four expansion pieces attached to our 400x400 TV (Sony Bravia). It's not a bad solution - putting the screw through one of the slats rather than an actual screw hole along with adding a couple washers to create tension with the too-long screws - but I'd rather it be truly universal as the description claims.But even with the installation difficulties, I'd still buy the product again because it's great quality for a low price.;4.0;Works great...once you go through the pain of getting it installed;1361750400;02 25, 2013;;

A1C1SR200MSJUM;972683275;joycemunro@hotmail.com;[0, 0];I recently rigged up a treadmill workstation in my office and wanted to find a mount for my monitor so that I wasn't craning my neck downward toward my laptop when walking and working.  I researched a number of articulating arms and selected this one because of the reviews and the length of the arm itself.As other reviews have noted, the product is constructed of solid materials.  While heavy, it was easily installed by my organization's maintenance staff.  One downside to this product is that while the arm length and location is fairly easy to adjust, I have not been able to easily adjust the pitch of the monitor (angle of the monitor face relative to the ground).  Thankfully when installed it was at an appropriate level for my use and is not a big issue. Another very slight issue is that the arm has the slightest wiggle to it, so that, when the arm is fully extended the monitor is slightly off level.  This may be more an issue of installation than product, however.On the whole, I'm very pleased with the product, particularly at the price that I paid for it.;4.0;"Installed in \Mobile\"" Office""";1351555200;10 30, 2012;;

This one was installed thru a plaster drywall into cinder block wall.  I used  the 2 wall anchors and bolts provided in the mounting accessory pack.

I like the fact that you can tilt it, rotate it (makes it easy to get the TV level)  and move it in and out a great distance and it will go back pretty flush to the wall.

Overall, I am very happy with this, a lot of options to move tv.  HDMI cable big bonus.  Looks great too, esp with cover.

Went out and bought one from Sams club knowing I could return it if it also had extension/tilt problems. Well the one from Sams Club (Omni Basic Series) was just fantastic and it came with two STEEL wire-run holders even though it is a bit shorter on the extension than this wall mount.My dad had a brand new sharp 32 inch LCD which weighed in around 24 lbs or so. Couldn't even imagine a bigger tv being extended with this. If you're going to keep the tv flat agaibst the wall this should be ok, but I wouldn't cheap out again.

A1WXU0BY2L7ZL9;972683275;"J. Galloway \Master Technologist\""""";[163, 172];This flat panel mount is adjustable and very cost effective, an excellent product for the money.  This arm comes with all needed mounting hardware for either masonry or wall stud mounting as well as a set of 4 screws for several sizes of panel mounting screws.  It also comes with a small wrench for two different sizes of hex heads on the arm and an allen wrench for one of the arm adjustments.  It is at least a two man operation to attach the flat screen after the arm is attached to the wall.  I mounted mine on a stud in the wall.  For stud mounting you use two of the six mounting hex head lag screws that come with it.  It doesn't say exactly in the directions but you should use a 1/4\ drill bit to pre-drill the holes in the stud.  I would not recommend trying to use the included hex wrench to tighten down the wall mounting lag screws, you need more leverage to tighten it than it provides;" use a crescent wrench or other longer hex wrench.  I used a stud finder to locate the studs accurately.  Make sure you do not have obvious pipes or electrical going through the wall at the chosen location.  They can throw off some stud finders.  If you want to quickly adjust one of the arm adjustment screws it also contains a replacement screw that has a slip bar top lever so that it can be loosened and tightened without a wrench.  There is one optional cable management loop that attaches to the bottom of the middle of the arm.  It could use one more at the wall, but that is easy to improvise.

The bracket and mount are sturdy enough but it will not articulate as smoothly as some of the higher priced models.

A20IY0H76J8ICM;972683275;Harvey Spector;[4, 5];I am awarding this mount 4 stars.I used the Video Secure mount for my 23 inch TV which weighed only 13lb. The hardware supplied was excellent for mounting it on a wood wall stud. The arm of the mount detaches so that it is easy to mount the wall plate to the stud. The mount was more than adequate for my light weight TV. It can be adjusted to swivel and tilt. The only negative was that while the plate mounted to the back of the TV with the screws provided, the lower left corner interfered with the power plug. Video Secure can provide a mount with a smaller plate. Rather than return my mount for the smaller plate, I chose to use a hacksaw and removed an approximately one by two inch corner in order to permit the plug to enter the TV. So with that caution in mind, I would recommend this product very highly. If I had ordered the smaller plate originally I would have rated it 5 Stars. I was able to do the job without any help. With a heavier TV, an extra pair of hands would be useful.;4.0;Sturdy TV mount;1288483200;10 31, 2010;;

The only thing that gave us a little trouble was the TV had a little raised curve on the back.  Therefore when we tried to attach the bar that connects to the TV, the bars did not sit flush.  We had to cut those bars down to get a flush mount.  Not sure if that is a fault of the TV mount or the TV itself.  Note: I don't know how the mounting sizes are created, i.e. 300x300, but the mount did say it would fit my TV and we still had to cut those bars.

A23S2XCWFZM976;972683275;Sauce On Side;[1, 1];"This was needed to mount a 32\ LCD that weighs 27 lbs in my bedroom. I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer. I have another 32\"" that needs mounted. I think as soon as I click publish for this review I will be ordering another one. If you find yourself reading reviews on TV mounts and you have found this one your search is over, just click buy already.""";5.0;Awesome TV mount;1388707200;01 3, 2014;;

Nothing about this looked like it was going to work but it does.  The unit is solid as others have said.  There are no instructions for brick, line it up so the holes are in the mortar rather than bricks, that way you can patch the holes if you ever move it.  Also, the cable management clips are pretty flimsy.  Otherwise than that, no complaints.  A little graphite lube on the hinges (sold for locks, wherever keys are cut) is good advice.  One major complaint, about the way these are sold by Amazon -- there are a bunch of different SKUs and you can't tell by this listing which one you're looking at.

The mount was easy to assemble and mount to wall. Although instructions call for finding a wall stud to mount, the hardware package includes large dry wall anchors and screws.  I opted to purchase \""Toggler\"" high performance drywall anchors/toggle bolts.  These cost a couple bucks for a package of two at any big box store and they hold up to 240 lbs each.  There was no stud near where I needed to mount the bracket for the TV mount, so I used four toggler bolts, which was probably overkill.  The TV itself easily mounted to the wall bracket with hardware provided.  TV was on the wall and in use in less than 30 minutes.  Really like the 15 degree angle, which works great in a bedroom.  For the price you can't beat this mount.  Although I will probably never use the articulating arm, it is great for adding/moving cables from behind the TV by simply pulling it away from the wall.

A25M2X8KHSS2NC;972683275;"Ultimate Ducky \Ultimate Ducky\""""";[8, 15];Unfortunately, I'm returning this mount.Though I like the look of it, particularly the two part plastic piece that clips to the wall mount portion to cover the bolts, I feel that the one I ordered wasn't well made.I purchased it to mount aLG 26LE5300 26-Inch 720p 60Hz LED LCD HDTVin our kitchen.The mount arrived quickly and was well packaged. Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. TheVideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1USgets very high marks from me. It's basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 VESA head on it. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.I understand that it's a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement. However, I just can't give this mount any higher rating than I have.;2.0;Poor Quality Control, May Block the Ports on Your TV;1283558400;09 4, 2010;10 14, 2010;
A25RTRAPQAJBDJ;972683275;Ted;[1, 1];This mount is heavy, strong and already in one piece. Almost no directions were needed. The only issue I would have: After the mount is installed I had to lift the TV to the mount and screw the screws in while holding the TV up with one hand. I checked the instructions to make sure I wasn't being stupid. The directions confirmed to lift the TV and screw in the screws. Other mounts have a bracket installed on the wall and TV, then I just lift the TV and click it right in. The sturdiness of the mount makes up for this defect in my opinion.;5.0;A great TV mount;1329523200;02 18, 2012;;

A27K5RT7VDB7BU;972683275;Stephan;[70, 92];I purchased this mount for my 37 inch LCD TV.  Installation was easy...  The trouble I encountered was due to a bad wall stud finder.  Make sure you have one when you install this mount because you need to screw the mount into a wall stud or at least have one screw into a wall stud.The arm of the mount sags after I hooked up my 37in. LCD TV to the mount.  My TV is within the weight limit of this mount (less than 55lbs.) but the arm still sags due to the weight of the TV.  I guess as long as it supports my TV, the sagging shouldn't be an issue.  It just looks funny from the side.  I do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break off.Overall, for the price this mount is a great deal and works but I would suggest purchasing it for flat screen TVs less than 37 inches.

One is 35 in LED and one is a 55 in Plasma.I gave it 3 stars because it was perfect for the 35 in.Tho for the 55 inch...using the extender bars...I have a problem with because they give when I try to pull the TV from being right up against the wall. At first I thought it was breaking, but I looked in the back and the arm is fine, but the TV is leaning away from the mount! The arms are not strong/stuff enough to hold my TV to the mount plate... It will start leaning to the side and will not hold well with the pivoting up and down.So if you are going to have to use the 4 extenders because the screws are not located in the square part in the center... I would recommend looking for a different product. They advertised for my size, but should also put a weight limit for the arm mount.;3.0;Good for smaller TVs;1367193600;04 29, 2013;;

Plus, the location was above the closet's sliding doors leaving only 17&#34; of vertical space on the wall. This mount allowed for such a tiny foot print with no problems. And it carried another solution of aligning the top of the mount and the top of TV because of the ceiling proximity. I could orient upper brackets horizontally and use a steeper angle for lower brackets. Because of a plethora of holes in the arm plate I could accommodate for any geometry. Amazingly, this kit comes with brackets-extenders if you need for weird TV form factors. The construction is very sturdy and there is no gaps in the joints. The TV can be turned and moved to any direction without skewing or loss of horizontal. Because of the extended arm it has another great potential by attaching your great old speakers to the back of the TV holding brackets.

It was super easy and was installed in on a matter of minutes.  Some of the other reviews indicated that there was not hardware included for mounting in wood studs, but I found that to be untrue.  There were 2- 4&#34; #4 Black lag bolts included with the hardware package.  So, you don't need to buy any additional hardware if you are mounting in wood studsThe only downside that I have found with this mount is the cable management clips that were included are of little use.

A2HG19HOW4IZ7L;972683275;Deepika Mahajan;[0, 0];This wall mount works perfectly for the TV in the guest room as the room is relatively small, and thus, we needed to place the TV in the corner. All in all this is very functional and has the ability to move in multiple dimensions. Note though it is difficult to easily tilt the TV down or up. A minor point is that the screws for the wall are very thick with the plastic screw anchors even thicker and so I had to drill really large holes - which given that I was mounting a 32 inch LCD-LED was not really necessary but would make sense for someone hanging a large plasma.The HDMI cable was a nice bonus and works very well.;5.0;Very functional;1320969600;11 11, 2011;;

So I took one articulating arm apart from another articulating arm (1 screw), attached wall mount to the wall (only used 2 screws into the stud with screws I bought at the hardware store--the tv weighs only 15 lbs & the device can hold 55 lbs if the correct screws are used), attached the television mount side to the tv while the tv was sitting face down on my couch (this is really the best way to do it because you don't have to balance anything)--and with only 1 screw to attach the two articulating arms together--and a big screw at that--I was able to put the tv up by myself.

I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs.  I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.  (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine.  Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.  Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises.  An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount.  If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).

A2KQDWZZUBBNOJ;972683275;Bradley Pool;[0, 0];I used it to mount a 32\ LCD TV to the wall... about 28LBS.  I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.PROS:-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.CONS:-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my &lt;"30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit \""off level\"" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the &lt";"$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.""";4.0;It works!;;

I did this because I had to install the tv ASAP and could not wait for a replacement. Also, the mounting bracket that attaches to the wall has a larger screw hole on the bottom. This means that the bottom can wiggle and the bracket will be misaligned. Again, I did a quick fix.

Your television probably cost you several hundred dollars, so entrusting it to this wall mount is a big leap of faith.I received mine about three weeks ago, and since I'm not handy, I had my buddy help me. You better be ready to drill, because you're going to be mounting it into the wall with multiple screws/brackets. You have to know how to find the stud in your drywall...It took my friend and I about forty-five minutes to install the unit.Included with the wall mount is a tool, some sort of wrench you will need, but it was so poorly constructed that we wore it away so badly in the first few minutes that it no longer turned the included screws.So far, for the last month, the wall mount has held my 32\ television (which falls within the allotted weight) up to the wall. There are two caveats: firstly, I NEVER pull it out, articulate it, turn it... nothing. I don't trust the wall mount enough to do anything but leave the television flush against the wall. Secondly, make sure you have a level with you, not just for installation, but pretty much for the life of the wall mount so you can make sure your television is level from time to time, in case you bump it or move it ever so slightly.Well, that's all there is to say.

A2MLE5H35UXP2Q;972683275;Rc;[0, 0];The mount itself seems well constructed.  I was hesitant about having only one brace against the wall to support a 40 inch tv but it seems to work.The only downside is that the beam above my fireplace is centered on the wall and to the fireplace... when the arm is completely folded and the tv is as close to the wall as possible, the arm does not line up with the mount.  The center point of the tv is not inline to where the mount is screwed into the wall, SO my tv is off centered.-Mount is screwed into beam, centered. When arm is retracted or folded fully to keep the tv against the wall, the tv center is off, it is next to the mount against the wall.Hope this makes sense.Other than that it works;4.0;Good mount but off center from arm;1359676800;02 1, 2013;;
A2MQ47BBL7F6B6;972683275;Corey Vena;[3, 3];I used this mount for an LG 32 inch LCD so it only needed to hold 30lbs which it is doing no problem.  I am only able to screw in two of the four screws to the back, but it seems to work just fine.  I saw in the other reviews complaints about the bolts and the need to make sure you mount the unit level as it does not adjust to compensate in that manor.  I think they must have addressed these problems because the bolts provided are sturdy and the tv has some play to compensate for any mistakes in mounting.;5.0;Great unit especially for the price.;1267747200;03 5, 2010;;

Because of the TV's location I wanted something that would provide flexability and movement for optimal viewing angles.  I looked at several brands but for the price I was leaning toward the VideoSecu mount. The product description says it will hold a screen up to 37\"" so this should be no problem.I would not recommend this for someone who needs to move a large screen very often because the mount becomes stiff at the various joints under the weight of the TV. If you are looking for something you can set in one place (or periodically move) that offers more flexability than a traditional wall mount, this is an awesome product for the price.If I had it to do over again, I'd buy the same mount...""";5.0;"VideoSecu Articulating Wall Mount for 37\ TV""";1301875200;04 4, 2011;;

Figure out how high you want want it, locate the center of the stud, pre-drill the hole and use a ratchet to screw in the bolts.

The bedroom TV is a 35\ LCD, and the TV in the living room is a 55\"" LED.  (Surprisingly enough, they both weigh 50 pounds...)  This mount works very well for both of them.  It's relatively simple to install - you just need to find a stud and screw the support in to it.  (I will admit that my bedroom TV has been attached not to a wall stud, but a jury-rigged support brace on a cabinet.  It's still there and attached after 6 months.)I will say that the joints in the arms are quite stiff - it can take a little muscle to move the TV.  But I think I prefer that - it certainly doesn't feel flimsy, and it stays wherever I put it.A tip for would-be purchasers: make sure your TV supports this mount.

This isn't completely the VideoSecu's problem, but since there is no flexibility at this size, I had to rig it together off-centered only using two screws on the bottom arms.* All of the mounts I have ever done have a tilt function, and this is by far the biggest pain I've ever dealt with.  Instead of using thumb screws, you have to use a wrench (cheap one included) to adjust the tilt.  It is much more difficult to get the TV held in place and tighten this way.* Similar to the above, the mount gives the ability to adjust leveling after it has been installed.  This is also done with a wrench, but it is a big pain and is very difficult to keep level (keeps slipping) even with a helper.* Lastly, be aware that when folded completely, the screen is not centered over the wall mount.  It is about 2-3&#34; to the left or right, depending on which way you fold the arms.  If you're looking for the flexibility of full motion but most of the time it will be against the wall, keep this in mind.";3.0;No flexibility for 600x400 VESA pattern, Slips Easily;1389657600;01 14, 2014;;

This mount came well packed and was shipped promptly.  After my initial inspection I was concerned about how stiff the mount gets from moving the arms back and forth.  The nuts on the joints kept getting too tight and caused the mounting bracket to bend under the load. Very soft metal was used and the construction is very low tech. I would be afraid that the thin new TV set would be damaged by the force required to move the mount.  I was very disappointed with the mount both with quality and the operation.

Use a regular 1/2 inch box-end wrench or rachet & socket.Main complaint is that there should be a way to attach the plate to the back of the TV and then attach plate to the mount arm as in other mounts I have bought.  I did take the last arm bolt out so I could attach plate to TV first, then simply lined them back up and had my son slide the bolt through and start the nut.

It mounted to the wall with no real problem, but since it is all one unit, you have to put the whole thing up, and then raise the TV up in the air, while you line up the screw holes in the plate with the holes in the TV back and get the screws started.  This is at least a two man operation, and our TV was small.  I cannot imagine doing this with a 32\ TV.  With the four screws in place and the TV up in the air, we started connecting the wires only to discover the cable connection was covered by the mounting plate.  Brought the assistant back, removed the TV from the mount, had to disassemble the mount to get the mounting plate off, then take a hacksaw and cut one corner off the mount plate to uncover the cable connection on the back of the TV when the plate is in place, and then put it all back together again.  The design of the mounting plate is such that it cannot be disconnected from the rest of the mount and then put on the back of the TV at ground level.  The plate needs to be able to be mounted on the TV back at ground level to make sure all connections for the wires are clear.  We got it up, and it works well, but having to do it all twice, and hacksaw a notch in the mount for the cable is not what I call \""easy installation\"".""";4.0;Have your own hacksaw;1286236800;10 5, 2010;;

A3DIXHIECTEKV2;972683275;Brett;[1, 1];TV plate that attaches to TV mount will not fit my TV. I was buying this as a replacement mount since I was moving the TV into the bedroom and needed a tilting mount. Possibly shame on me for having a generic made tv and not knowing the exact VESA mounting pattern but I have used the same TV with another universal mount with no issues. Problem was that where my mounting holes in the TV were, I would have almost had to drill a home made hole in the metal to accomodate the tv.  I needed a hole exactly in the middle of where the mount curves inward.If this mount would have worked, I would have given it 4 stars.  Seems to be reasonably well made for the price with a heavy metal. Definitely much better quality from the speaker mounts I bought from the same manufacturer.  The only negative I saw what the tilt motion.  Instructions make it seem like the tilt is accomplished where the tv meets the mount.  This is in fact not true.  You have to loosen a bolt near where the mount holds to the wall and position the mount up and down on a curved insert.  So if installing, be aware that if you need the tilt to arrange it before you mount.If I were actually able to make it as far as mounting to the wall, then that would have been easy.  Just make sure you have a high powered drill to make it through the stud.;2.0;Will be returning;1342051200;07 12, 2012;;

I unpacked the mount to put up a new flat panel TV in my bedroom and it took me about 20 minutes from unpacking to secure the mount to the wall (another 40 minutes to mount the TV). You'll need some hand tools like a drill with drill bits to drill holes in your wall and a socket wrench to secure the bolts to the wall. Having a second person help you hold the mount while you screw it to the wall is very helpful since the mount is heavy and your arms get tired holding it over your head. You should also spray some WD40 to lubricate the joints prior to mounting it to the wall so the arm swings easily. You will also need a stud finder to attach the mount to wooden studs in the wall. Having the other person hold the TV while you screw in the four screws to the TV mounting plate is a must.

You MUST read the instructions, as hanging a single stud wall mount needs to be more precise than a two stud mount.

A3PR648T8RDRS;972683275;m m smits;[0, 0];Got this to replace a Peerless Paramount wall mount when I got my new TV.  Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.Three stars for ease of installation, five stars for usability, for a combined four stars.

The bracket is well built, easy to install and has clean lines (no exposed mounting bolts).  An area of the bracket that could be improved is the swivel joint at the back of the TV plate that is used to adjust forward tilt and level of the TV. It works and is sturdy once adjusted but adjustment is by trial and error. Adjustment is achieved by loosening 4 bolts, moving the TV to the desired TV tilt and level and then tightening the bolts while steadying the TV. After tightening the bolts and releasing the TV there is some movement of the joint. Getting the desired tilt and level took several tries.;4.0;VideoSecu Long Arm TV Wall Mount is sturdy and does a good job.;1390435200;01 23, 2014;;

I especially like the mount cover that hides the bolt heads.  Before I bought this item, I read most of the reviews here.  I thought I would address some of the negatives I read and have now experienced.  One review talked about how tight the mount was to move.  There is a simple answer to that...loosen the bolts on those joints!  Others mentioned how it was a two person job to mount.  While it might take two people to figure out where to mount it, I mounted this in an RV six feet high by myself.  Just take the bolts off of the bracket with the included wrench, mount it, then put the bracket back on.  I also read that the TV was hard to put on once the mount was on the wall.  There is a top screw on the middle joint that can be removed.  Then mount the bracket to the TV.  Then put the middle section back together by simply sliding it onto the post it came off of.  I don't travel with the TV mounted in the RV so I take it off and put it on this same way and never struggle at all.  Another review talked about the mount being out of square with the TV.  This mount is endlessly adjustable and the tilt and pitch both of the TV can be adjusted.  All in all this is a solid mount with endless adjustments.  It even includes a small loop to help with cable management.  For the money, I can't believe there is something out there better.

Loosen it just enough so that the movement doesn't require too much force.  It didn't take long to install this tv mount either.  It bolts to the wall using 6 lag screws: one at each corner, and then two at the center just above and below the \arm.\""  It comes with all of the lag bolts neccessary for installation to a stud.  In my case, there were two corner bolt holes that miss the stud because of the width of the mounting plate, but this kit comes with anchors and screws for this scenario.  Definitely worth the purchase!""";5.0;Perfect compatibilty with Sony;1319587200;10 26, 2011;;

A6UFYXM3VDZ;972683275;Mark K. Andrews;[0, 0];I bought this wall mount to hold a LG 32 inch LCD TV.  Given that this mount can support almost twice the weight of my TV, it was a little bit of overkill but better safe than sorry.  The unit is already assembled right out of the box and just needs to be attached to the TV and a wall stud.  I made a quick template by rubbing a blank piece of paper on top of the wall bracket with a pencil. I then used a stud finder to locate the nearest studs where I wanted the TV to be and taped the template to the wall.  I used a drill driver to make pilot holes for the lag screws which helps greatly with getting them in.  I was able to use four of the lag screws.  There is a plastic two piece lag screw cover (included) that clicks together easily over the lag screw heads to make for a clean look.  The wall bracket allows for different screw patterns for easier installation.  Once I had the mount secured to the wall, it was time to attach the TV to its bracket.  This took two of us to do it quickly.  One lifted the TV and the other pressed the bracket flush against the TV and hand tightened the four screws that go into the back of it. This allowed the TV to be supported easier while a screwdriver was used to finish tightening the four screws.  After that, it was just a matter of adjusting the angle of the mount for the best TV viewing.This thing works as advertised.  The extension arm works smoothly and without much effort.  The tilt function has a nut that loosens to allow for pivot adjustments.  The cord management system works well to bundle the various cables and makes for a clean look.  You can pay a lot more for another mounting system but I doubt it will be better!;5.0;Easy to use right out of the box!;1315958400;09 14, 2011;;

Polk recommends these speakers be mounted at least 2' off the wall to keep from muffling the rear facing bass port and this mount fits the bill to a T for a heck of a lot less expense than the typical center channel speaker stands sell for ... Bonus!BTW, these Polk Monitor 40s are essentially the same speaker as their purpose built center channel speakers for 1/2 the price as I got a pair of 'em for what Polk sells single center channel speakers, and .... got a 2nd one to use for the center channel for my BR system in the process. So long as you don't mind either standing them up as intended or that the Polk emblem ends up sideways when you lay 'em on their sides like I did, they make a great center channel speaker for a bargain price.This did require some inventive modifying with my die grinder and a cut off wheel to cut away most of the mounting pad intended for attaching to various monitors/Tvs, then a lil touch up painting after the cutting but what I ended up with was just what I needed. The cable management already in place works just as well for speaker wire as it would have for an HDMI or similar video cable too.Yeah, these are of Chinese manufacture, but I was unable to find a similar American made product, and let me assure you, I did try.

It rotates at multiple angles and seems to fit practically any television mounting layout.  I have 2 major problems with it.  The first is that the mounting diagram that came with my mount, the one that you hang on the wall to drill holes, did not match up with the actual holes on the mount.  I drilled the holes in my wall before I realized this.  The second issue I have is that when the mount is pushed all the way back, the television is not centered on the mount.  The piece that the television actually attaches to is off center several inches to the left.  I thought, prior to purchasing, that the television would lay centered on the wall against the wall mount bracket while pushed all the way back.The mount does seem very well made so I gave it 3 stars, but it definitely didn't look like I imagined on the wall.

One is a hex key and it works. The other in a small box wrench. Throw the box wrench away as it is at least 1mm larger than the lags bolts provided and thus slips when used, could cause minor injury, and is totally useless. BTW, the pre- mounted bolts, as shipped, are torqued on tightly, watch the fingers and hands so as not to mash them once the torque pressure is released as you untighten them.  I strongly suggest using your own tools. Either a racket wrench or correct size box wrench. The lag bolts provided for mounting are large and should be mounted in a wall stud 2x4. To prevent splitting the stud, drill progressively larger pilot holes until you acheive the size correct for the mounting the lag bolts. The instructions are minimal and vague. For instance, there is a small component provided which looks like a screw cap with a small barbell thru the top.  Interesting, but here is no explanation what it is for. Also the mounting lag bolts should be six in number"; only five were included in my shipment, so I winged it with a lag bolt of my own.

For the price this mount is excellent. Why pay more for something that you will not see and does the same job as other high priced mounts. The only thing I did not like was the way the instructions have you mount the TV after the bracket is attached to the wall but like another reviewer stated, I removed the head from the arm, attached it to the TV and then reattached the head to the arm and slid the bolt that I removed back in. I did reverse the orientation of the bolt by having it drop in instead of pushing it in from the bottom. It made it much easier. After 15 years of having a TV on the edge of my dresser I finally freed that space up and have my TV mounted on the wall and I am very happy with this purchase.;4.0;Price is great for excellent product.

Installation was simple, though I used the screws from the original monitor mount for the plate attachment, as none of those included would work with my monitor.  The tilt mechanism requires loosening a bolt and then adjusting the monitor to the desired angle.  I would have preferred another 10-15 degrees of vertical tilting capability, but what is available will be fine for most applications.

AML8NIWFKHZJU;972683275;4all2read;[0, 1];The TV would not stay level on mine.  Turned out to have two problems.  First - the slot in the little bracket that the bigger TV bracket hangs onto was a bit too high so the little bolt was resting on the slots bottom edge.  I drilled it out to be 1/16 of an inch lower and that solved the problem.  I also put a lock washer on the bolt between the two plates. Second - the top bolt hole in the single arm was not in the center.  I drilled it much larger so the bolt going through the bottom hole could be straight up and down which fixed that problem.  (When the bolt was tightened it automatically became perpendicular to the bottom hole.)  These problems show insufficient quality control and should not happen, I therefore recommend you try another brand.;3.0;TV Would not Stay Level - How I Fixed it;1383782400;11 7, 2013;;

ANJY75Z24A6AG;972683275;Jimmy Wissman;[1, 1];This is exactly what I needed.  It was easy to mount and supports my 40 inch TV (26 lbs) without any issue.  I haven't tested the extension brackets, but the rest of the device is very solid.  I will say that the hinges can be a bit tight, and it's not designed to be easily adjustable on the fly (you'll need a few tools).  If you plan on swinging your TV around a lot, this might not be the best choice, but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then.  My favorite part is the small base.  I didn't have a lot of wall space to mount a TV, and this met my needs without eating all my money.  Keep in mind that you'll want at least two people to mount the TV on this device.  I attached my TV alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while I inserted the screws.  Speaking of which, I've mounted two TVs on this, and the box included screws which fit both (in addition to many more).  However, you may need a few more washers.;5.0;Great!;1363305600;03 15, 2013;;

The unit arrived very quickly and seems well made - that is until you start using it.Installation was quick and easy, apart from using the supplied wrench, which did not last for installation of more than two of the supplied six screws before losing it's grip. I finished installation with my own adjustable wrench, so this is something to be aware of as you may have to provide your own tools.My major concern is the arm of the mount. Although it supports the TV (27 pounds), the arm tends to sag when extended which defeats the purpose of the mount. If you will use the TV flush with the wall, it works well, but expect problems with tilt and sag when the TV is extended.I will keep this unit, but the next mount will be a different make and/or model.""";3.0;Not Bad, But Not Good Either.....;1315267200;09 6, 2011;;

The installation process was quick and easy and we LOVE the variety of angles that you can get from this mount. We have it on a side wall in our bedroom and we can pull the tv out and move it completely perpendicular to the wall on which it is mounted if we want to. (We don't usually move it quite perpendicular, but it works to do this.)My only complaint is that the joints are a little on the stiff side. It takes quite a bit of force to move the TV from one position to another. It's a little hard for my wife to do-- especially with the TV mounted about 6ft up on the wall. It may be possible to loosen these pivot points, but I have not tried. I'm a little nervous about making it less stable if I do.Overall, it's a great mount.

AYRACCER8JXU1;972683275;J H;[0, 0];Ok quality.  Good value.  I've got the arm angled (not straight out) and the middle hinge DOES show some bend or flex.  Angle adjustments up/down are not the easiest to do, so this is not a good choice if you'll be adjusting your TV often.;4.0;Ok quality, ok features, good value;1386460800;12 8, 2013;;

I checked out their web site to get a little clarity that was helpful. It took less than 1 hour to get this on the wall & mount my 32\ Samsung. It was so easy I was able to do it all alone.""";5.0;Easy as pie;1337299200;05 18, 2012;;
AYYNNAEWP3W5Y;972683275;JMH;[0, 0];This TV mount I bought for just $25 easily outdoes similar ones that cost over $100! It comes preassembled, is easy to mount on the wall, and has clear instructions. It also features a wire holder and cover for the screws on the wall. The joints are a little bit stiff, but with use and maybe a drop of oil this shouldn't be a problem. Definetely a great buy at a agreat price!;5.0;Great!;1322870400;12 3, 2011;;

Everything seems to be made well, it was easy to install myself, and the TV has been hanging for 2 months now from a brick wall at it's full reach.

AZO3DZAJ8S0D9;972683275;Mike;[0, 0];Wall mount worked great and the price beats paying $80-$100 at a store seems like great quality I put a 40 inch Magnavox on it about a month ago and still on wall! Only problem I had was screws were a little to long that went into back of tv and wouldn't completely tighten up. I ground them down a bit but a couple of small washers would have worked well also. I think it was just the brand of tv and the diameter of screw needed. Kit did come with various sizes of screws for the back of tv.;5.0;working great! still on the wall!;1389830400;01 16, 2014;;

AZTC7YC8PKG39;972683275;R.;[0, 0];Installed very easy, very secure, inexpensive, very flexible and easy to use.  Just pre drill and angle the outside bolts inward (2 are centered, 4 are on the edges) a bit towards the center of the wall stud so they grab better. The cover plate will hide angled bolt heads.;5.0;Great Product;1354838400;12 7, 2012;;
